## Requirements

- Elixir `1.14+` with Erlang/OTP `25+`
- Git

---

## Installation

### Install Elixir

Elixir runs on the Erlang virtual machine, so **Erlang/OTP is required** Elixir cannot run without
it. Every package manager below installs Erlang/OTP for you as a dependency. The only path that needs
a separate Erlang step is the Windows manual installer (see below).

**Windows:**

*Option A package manager (recommended, installs Erlang automatically):*

```cmd
winget install Elixir.Elixir
```

*Option B manual installer (two installers, in this order):*

1. Download and run the **Erlang/OTP installer** from https://www.erlang.org/downloads
2. Run `erl -s halt` to check which OTP version you got
3. Download the **Elixir installer built for that exact OTP** from https://elixir-lang.org/install.html (`elixir-otp-<N>.exe`) and run it

Then open Command Prompt and verify:

```cmd
elixir --version
```

The output prints both versions, for example `Elixir 1.14.0 (compiled with Erlang/OTP 25)`.

**Linux (Ubuntu / Debian):**

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y elixir
elixir --version
```

**macOS:**

```bash
brew install elixir
elixir --version
```

> If you do not have Homebrew, install it first from https://brew.sh

**Termux (Android):**

```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade -y
pkg install elixir -y
elixir --version
```

> If the `elixir` package is not available in your Termux repository, install an Ubuntu environment first with `pkg install proot-distro`, then `proot-distro install ubuntu`, then `proot-distro login ubuntu` and run the Linux command above inside it.

### Clone and Install

**Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yuurisan-N1/Poe-Miniapp.git
cd Poe-Miniapp
```

**Install dependencies:**

This bot uses only the Elixir standard library, so there is nothing to install. Erlang/OTP was already installed by the step above.

---

## Configuration

### 1. Accounts (data.txt)

Fill `data.txt` with Telegram WebApp `initData` for each account, one per line:

```
user=%7B%22id%22...&hash=abc123
user=%7B%22id%22...&hash=def456
```

> `initData` can be obtained from the browser DevTools when opening the Poe Miner Miniapp on Telegram Web.

### 2. Proxy (proxy.txt)

Fill `proxy.txt` with proxies, one per line (optional, leave empty to run without proxy):

```
host:port
host:port:user:pass
http://user:pass@host:port
```

Proxies are assigned to accounts by index in round-robin order.

### 3. Bot Settings (config.json)

`sleep_seconds` controls how many seconds the bot waits between cycles. If `config.json` is missing, it is created automatically with a default of `3600` seconds.

`telegram_task` toggles the Telegram-category tasks in the task list. Set it to `false` and every task whose `category` is `telegram` is skipped: no claim request is sent and nothing extra is printed. Tasks from other categories keep running normally. Default is `true`.

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "sleep_seconds": 3600,
    "telegram_task": true
  }
}
```

The key is optional. When it is missing, or holds anything that is not a boolean, the bot falls back to `true`.

---

## Running the Bot

**Linux / macOS:**

```bash
elixir --erl "+Bd" bot.exs
```

**Windows:**

```cmd
elixir --erl "+Bc" bot.exs
```

Or just double click `run_pc.bat`, which runs the Windows command above.

## Features

### Account State
At the start of every account the bot reads the full account snapshot and logs the account name together with the current POE balance from the pool wallet.

### Mining Session
When no mining session is running the bot opens one. When a session is still running the bot prints how much time is left and moves straight on to the tasks and the referral bonus it never parks the cycle on a multi-hour countdown, so every account is processed on every pass. Once the timer has run out, the next cycle claims the reward. The claimed amount is not taken from the request: the bot re-reads the account afterwards and logs the real balance gain, so a claim that credited nothing is never reported as a reward.

### Task Rewards
Every active task from the task list is claimed in order, except tasks whose category is switched off in `config.json`. The reward logged is the amount the server returns with the claim itself. A task that still requires a manual channel join is reported as such and skipped, and a task that was already completed is reported instead of being claimed twice.

Tasks whose category is disabled are filtered out before the list is walked: they are neither claimed nor mentioned, and the printed task count reflects only the tasks that will actually run. When every remaining task in the list has already been completed, the bot says so once.

### Referral Bonus
The bot reads the referral summary for the account and collects the available referral bonus when the server reports one. Accounts with no pending bonus are reported as such.

### Wallet Gating
Mining requires a TON payout wallet linked inside the miniapp. When the server refuses the mining start for that reason, the bot reports it once and moves on to the tasks it never invents a session or a reward for an account that cannot mine.

### Multi Account
All accounts in `data.txt` are processed sequentially within every cycle. Each account is logged with its index, its name and its balance. The cycle number is tracked and logged at the start of each round.

### Proxy Support
Proxies are loaded from `proxy.txt` and assigned to accounts by position in round-robin order. Proxy credentials are masked in log output. Running without proxies is fully supported.

### Auto Countdown
Every wait inside the cycle displays a live `HH:MM:SS` countdown in place, and after all accounts complete a cycle the bot shows a countdown until the next cycle starts. A mining session that is still counting down is reported as a single line instead, so it never stalls the rest of the cycle.
